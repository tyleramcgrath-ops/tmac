#!/usr/bin/env bash
# SEO-GOD daily runner — macOS / Linux (and Git Bash, where `claude` resolves on PATH).
#
# Run it FROM THE PROJECT ROOT: the directory that holds seo-god.json. The
# scheduler entry created by references/schedule.md sets that working directory.
#
# It probes the local OpenSEO container, hands the run to Claude Code
# (`/seo-god daily`), and ALWAYS leaves a run marker at .seo-god/last-run.json —
# the file SKILL.md's missed-run self-check reads:
#   {"ts":"<UTC ISO 8601>","ok":true|false,"notes":"<short>"}
# The marker is this script's alone; references/act.md never writes it.
#
# Requires: bash, the `claude` CLI. `curl` and `node` are optional — they serve
# only the readiness probe (node reads openseo.url out of seo-god.json), so a
# machine without them still runs the loop and says so in the marker notes.
#
# --skill-dir <path> points at THIS skill's folder. A headless session can only
# read files inside its working directories, and the skill lives outside the
# project, so without --add-dir on that path `claude -p` can read none of
# references/*.md and the loop runs on SKILL.md's summary alone. The installer
# passes the real path into the scheduler entry; the default below covers a
# hand-run. Defaults to ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/skills/seo-god.
#
# SEO_GOD_DRY_RUN=1 prints what would happen, writes an ok:true "dry-run"
# marker, and exits 0 — no network call, no Claude Code session.
#
# There is no per-run timeout here on purpose: the OS scheduler owns the
# execution time limit (references/schedule.md sets it).
